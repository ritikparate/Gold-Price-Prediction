Welcome to our Gold Price Prediction GitHub repository! Here, we present a comprehensive gold price prediction project utilizing seven years of historical data. We've employed various powerful models including ARIMA, Prophet, Linear Regression, LSTM, and more to predict gold prices for the next 30 days. After rigorous model validation and evaluation, we've achieved an accuracy exceeding 95%. Additionally, we've deployed the most accurate model over the web using Streamlit, providing an interactive platform for users to access and visualize the forecasts.

Key Features:

Data Preparation: Seven years of meticulously curated gold price data were gathered and prepared for model training and evaluation.

Multiple Model Implementation: Utilized ARIMA, Prophet, Linear Regression, LSTM, and other advanced models to forecast gold prices, allowing for diverse perspectives on future price trends.

Model Validation and Evaluation: Conducted thorough validation and evaluation processes to ensure the models' accuracy, achieving a validation accuracy of over 95%.

Streamlit Web Deployment: The repository includes a user-friendly web interface developed using Streamlit. This interface allows users to interact with the most accurate model, visualize predictions, and gain valuable insights into future gold price trends.

Models Implemented:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Prophet (Facebook's forecasting tool)
Linear Regression
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
